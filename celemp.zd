\section{General Overview\label{genover}}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
     Celestial Empire is a play-by-email game based on Return From
Sirius, a play-by-snail-mail game by The Missing Tiger.  Using the Unix
mail system, the game sends out turn sheets to  the  players,  who
then mail all their actions back to the game  within  a  certain
number of days.

     Celestial Empire is a long term game for 9 players at a time.
Each  of  the  players start off by owning one  planet, their  home
world, and five small spaceships.
As the game progresses each player will build new ships and claim
more planets using these ships.
By about the third
turn,  players  should be meeting their neighbors in the  galaxy,
and here diplomacy takes over,  in the form of trade or war. There
are  a  variety of winning conditions determined before  the  game
starts. These include:

\begin{itemize}
\item Scoring 30,000 pts or greater.
\item Taking $\frac{1}{4}$ of the galaxy (64 planets).
\item Owning Earth for a full turn.
\item Having an income of 2000.
\item Having more than 2500 Earth Credits.
\end{itemize}

Another sort of winning condition is having the greatest of some commodity
(ships, credits, score, income etc.) at the end of a specified number of
turns. The number of turns can be either fixed for the whole game, or be
dynamically changed by the players as the game progresses.

     Planets  are the main source of income for  players.  Planets
can  have 10 different sorts of mines (types 0--9) and  their  respective
ore  types;  the more mines the more ore is produced  every  turn.
Some  planets will also have industry which enables the player  to
build  various  items  on that  planet from the ore.
Planetary  Defense  Units
(PDUs)  can  be built or unloaded onto a planet to make  it  more
difficult  for other players to take it  over. Connecting  planets
together are planetary links, down which ships travel; all planets
have  at least one and many have up to four.  The link operates  in
both directions,  if you can go from planet A to B you can also go
from planet B to A.

     Ships are the means of expansion for player's  empires.  Ships
consist  of various units.  There is the main hull and  hyperdrive
unit,  which cannot be destroyed. To build a ship you build one of
these.  Attached  to  the hull/hyperdrive unit are  other smaller
units:  fighter,  cargo,  tractor,  and shield units, which can be
built  on  after  the ship has been  built.  Fighter  units
allow you to attack other ships or planets.  Cargo units
allow  you to carry ores,  mines etc. from one planet  to  another.
Tractor units allow you to lock onto another ship and take it with
you when your ship jumps down a link.  Finally shield units protect
the ship from other player's attacks.

Commands are mailed, one per line, to the address listed at the top of
the turn sheet, see section~\ref{exheader} for an example.  Comments
can be put in the turn sheet, if the first character is a semi-colon
`;' then the line will be ignored, and all characters after a `;' on a
command line will also be ignored. Blank lines are also permitted.  If
everyone gets their turns in early, the game turn will be run early,
however if some people get their turns in late, the game will not be
delayed for them.  If you mail off your commands, and then realize you
have made a massive blunder, mail a correct list of commands in (not
just the different ones) to the mail address and ask that they be run
instead. If you get your commands in in time, they will be fixed.

If you are interested in the workings of Celestial Empire, the source is
available by ftp from {\tt yoyo.\-cc.\-monash.\-edu.\-au} in the
{\tt /pub/celemp} directory. The latest version of the documentation is also
in this directory.

As well there is a low volume mailing list that discusses various
new aspects of the game. To get on the mailing list, mail {\tt
listserv@yoyo.\-cc.\-monash.\-edu.\-au} and put the line
``{\tt SUB celemp-list}'' in the body of the message.

\item Spacemine attack resolution (automatic)
\item Mining (automatic)
\item Damage Resolution (automatic)
\item Change of Ownership (automatic)
\item Score adjustment (automatic)
\end{enumerate}
\end{multicols}

The sequence of execution is important. For example if you tell a planet
to build 10 Spacemines, and it only has enough industry to build 8, then
any other orders for building, like PDUs will be ignored as all the
industry has already been used.

     The events that are labeled automatic are automatically performed by the
computer and no  orders  concerning
them need by given.  All of the actions can be given for the  same
ship except for battle and movement. If your ship initiates combat
it then cannot move by itself, however it can still be towed by another
ship with enough tractor beams.

     All  orders concerning ships (except the  initial  hyperdrive
construction  order)  begin with an `S' followed by the  number  of
the ship and then the order. Orders concerning planets should just
have the planet number first, no `P' should be placed in front. There
should be no spaces in the order itself,  except possibly in a name.
Case does not matter when giving orders (except when naming things).

     Note  that the name  of the ship or planet is  for the player
use only,  all instructions to the computer should list the number,
NOT the name.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Naming\label{naming}}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
A ship or planet that belongs to you may be named whatever you wish.
The only restriction is that the name should
be less than 24 characters long, including spaces. \ie up to 23 characters
long. The Game Administrator will change any that are deemed unfit.
Planets are given an initial name, but these may be changed in the usual
manner.

Before the game starts, the players mail the Game Administrator with
the name of their empire. These can be up to 9 characters long. If an
empire changes hands sometime during the game, if for example a player
couldn't continue and gave control to another person, then the
Administrator can change the empire's name.

\subsection{Naming Ships} %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{zdchunk}

\end{tabbing}
\end{zdchunk}

\subsection{Naming Planets}%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{zdchunk}
\begin{tabbing}
Syntax:\\
\hspace{\sepspace} \= {\em xxx}={\em planetname} \hspace{\sepspace} \= Call planet {\em xxx} {\em planetname}\\

Examples:\\

\end{tabbing}
\end{zdchunk}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Gifts\label{gifts}}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
     Diplomacy is very important in Celestial Empire,  you  cannot
survive  if  everyone  hates  you,   unless  of  course  they  are
incompetent.  To assist in diplomacy,  you can bribe players  with
gifts of ore, mines, industry, PDUs, ships or even planets.
Money is not able to be gifted directly (Indirect methods include gifting
ships full of ore around Earth).

To give ores, mines, industry or PDUs just unload them on the other player's
planet. To give ships and planets, use the commands below.

\subsection{Gifting Ships}%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
You cannot give away more than two ships in a single turn, otherwise your
merchant families will have you assassinated.
\begin{zdchunk}
\begin{tabbing}
Syntax:\\
\hspace{\sepspace} \= S{\em xxx}G{\em playername} \hspace{\sepspace} \= Give ship {\em xxx} to {\em playername}\\

Examples:\\
\> \verb+S244GMASTER+ \> Give ship 244 to MASTER\\
\end{tabbing}
\end{zdchunk}

\subsection{Gifting Planets}%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
You cannot gift away your home planet, your populace will think you are a 
traitor and imprison you.
Also you cannot give away more than three planets in a single turn, otherwise
your populace will think you are trying to destroy their empire.

\begin{zdchunk}
\begin{tabbing}
Syntax:\\
\hspace{\sepspace} \= {\em xxx}G{\em playername} \hspace{\sepspace} \= Give planet {\em xxx} to {\em playername}\\

Examples:\\
\> \verb+345GWARLORD+ \> Give planet 345 to WARLORD\\
\end{tabbing}
\end{zdchunk}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Formal Alliances\label{alliances}}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% Modified 2/5/92 to include new ALLY status
     Celestial Empire has a four level alliance system, whereby a
player can rate other players as an ally, friend, neutral or enemy. At the
beginning  of the game all players are  considered  neutral.  Each
turn  you are allowed to change your ratings, but you cannot  go
from  friendly to enemy or from neutral to ally or vice versa in one turn
you must first pass through neutral. \ie you can only change your alliance
level with a player one level per turn.

% Added 2/5/92
    If you declare a player as an ally, they can do almost anything that you
can. They can jump through your systems without getting your PDUs firing on 
them. They can load ore and pdus from your planets and even mines and industry
from your home planet. You cannot fire onto an allies planets or ships, except
at spacemines. You can build units onto an allies ships. An ally can
use your research planets, if you do not use it. If a player wins, all his 
allies are considered joint winners. Having an allies ship in orbit above your
planet will not change ownership if it would otherwise. To sum all this up, only
declare a player an ally if you trust him with your empires life, and only if
they declare you an ally at the same time.

     If you declare a player as a friend,  your PDUs treat  their
ships as they would yours.  That is,  you cannot order your PDU to
fire  at  his ships and they will not automatically  fire  at  his
armed ships as they jump through your planets.  This means that he
can move his ships rapidly through your empire to help participate
in  a battle.  Your ships will also be unable to fire upon his ships.
(It also means that he can quickly reach your  home
planet to stab you in the back; but then what are friends for?)

     Declaring a player neutral returns the PDU to  automatic,  so
that  they will attack the fighter units on any armed ships  making
multiple jumps above your planets.

     Declaring  a  player an enemy retains the  automatic  defense
function,  but  also allows you to order your PDU to fire  at  his
stationary ships, whether they are armed or not.

\begin{zdchunk}
\begin{tabbing}
Syntax:\\
\hspace{\sepspace} \= +playername \hspace{\sepspace} \= Become more friendly with playername\\
\> -playername \> Become more hostile with playername\\

Examples:\\
\> \verb@+Assassin@ \> Become more friendly with Assassin\\
\> \verb+-PsiNinja+ \> Become more hostile with PsiNinja\\
\end{tabbing}
\end{zdchunk}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Unloading\label{unloading}}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
     The following objects may be carried on ships, in their cargo
units,  these  can  be unloaded onto any  planet:  ore  (including
fuel),  PDUs,  industry,  mines and spacemines.

\subsection{Unloading Mines}%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Mines are the largest item that can be carried on ships, they each take 20
cargo units to carry. Mines can only be loaded from the player's home planet,
but can be unloaded upon any planet. Mines can be unloaded as a different type
than what they were loaded as. The only restriction is that to unload a mine onto
a planet, there has to be already a mine of that type there. You can even unload
them on another players planet. Mine type changing is especially
useful on your home planet, where you get a large cargo ship, load up on mines
that you have a surplus of and unload them as a type that you are short of,
continually adjusting your production to meet your needs.

\begin{zdchunk}
\begin{tabbing}
Syntax:\\
\hspace{\sepspace} \= S{\em xxx}U{\em yy}R{\em z} \hspace{\sepspace} \= Unload {\em yy} of ore type {\em z} from ship {\em xxx}\kill
\> S{\em xxx}U{\em yy}M{\em z} \> Unload {\em yy} mines of type {\em z} from ship {\em xxx}\\

Examples:\\
\> \verb+S276U4M3+ \> Unload 4 mines of type 3 from ship 276\\
\end{tabbing}
\end{zdchunk}

\subsection{Unloading PDUs}%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Each PDU takes two cargo units to carry. They can be unloaded on any planet,
even ones that you do not own, but they defend whatever planet they are unloaded
on, even against the player who unloaded them.

\begin{zdchunk}
\begin{tabbing}
Syntax:\\
\hspace{\sepspace} \= S{\em xxx}U{\em yy}R{\em z} \hspace{\sepspace} \= Unload {\em yy} of ore type {\em z} from ship {\em xxx}\kill
\> S{\em xxx}U{\em yy}D \> Unload {\em yy} PDUs from ship {\em xxx}\\

Examples:\\
\> \verb+S234U3D+ \> Unload 3 PDUs from ship 234\\
\end{tabbing}
\end{zdchunk}

\subsection{Unloading Industry}%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Each industry takes 10 cargo units to carry. They can be unloaded on any planet.
However they can only be loaded from the player's home planet.
\begin{zdchunk}
\begin{tabbing}
Syntax:\\
\hspace{\sepspace} \= S{\em xxx}U{\em yy}R{\em z} \hspace{\sepspace} \= Unload {\em yy} of ore type {\em z} from ship {\em xxx}\kill
\> S{\em xxx}U{\em yy}I \> Unload {\em yy} industry from ship {\em xxx}\\

Examples:\\
\> \verb+S286U2I+ \> Unload 2 industry from ship 286\\
\end{tabbing}
\end{zdchunk}

\subsection{Unloading Ore}%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Ore of a specific type can be unloaded onto any planet, irrespective of what ore
types there are already present. Each unit of ore takes 1 cargo unit to carry.

\begin{zdchunk}
\begin{tabbing}
Syntax:\\
\hspace{\sepspace} \= S{\em xxx}U{\em yy}R{\em z} \hspace{\sepspace} \= Unload {\em yy} of ore type {\em z} from ship {\em xxx}\\

Examples:\\
\> \verb+S132U42R2+ \> Unload 42 of ore type 2 from ship 132\\
\end{tabbing}
\end{zdchunk}

\subsection{Unloading Spacemines}%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Spacemines take up one cargo unit each. They can be unloaded on any planet,
including those belonging to other players. However when unloaded they go to
the planetary stockpile, they are not deployed around the planet. See
Section~\ref{spacemines} for details on deploying spacemines from ships.

\begin{zdchunk}
\begin{tabbing}
Syntax:\\
\hspace{\sepspace} \= S{\em xxx}U{\em yy}R{\em z} \hspace{\sepspace} \= Unload {\em yy} of ore type {\em z} from ship {\em xxx}\kill
\> S{\em xxx}U{\em yy}S \> Unload {\em yy} spacemines from ship {\em xxx}\\

Examples:\\
\> \verb+S322U23S+ \> Unload 23 spacemines from ship 322\\
\end{tabbing}
\end{zdchunk}

\subsection{Global Unloading}%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
There is a global unload command to facilitate unloading of large amounts
of ore onto a single planet. This command unloads ALL ore except type 0
onto the planet below. If you want to unload ore type 0 you will have to
give a specific order to do so. If you want to unload all except ore type
4 for example, you can do a global unload, and then load the ore 4 back
onto the ship (as long as you own the planet), as loading occurs after
unloading.

\begin{zdchunk}
\begin{tabbing}
Syntax:\\
\hspace{\sepspace} \= S{\em xxx}U{\em yy}R{\em z} \hspace{\sepspace} \= Unload {\em yy} of ore type {\em z} from ship {\em xxx}\kill
\> S{\em xxx}U \> Unload all ore except fuel (ore 0) from ship {\em xxx}\\

Examples:\\
\> \verb+S309U+ \> Unload all ore except type 0 from ship 309\\
\end{tabbing}
\end{zdchunk}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Loading\label{loading}}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
     Loading  can occur only if the player owns the  planet.
The ship on which you are loading the item must be large enough to
carry it. Table~\ref{cargo} shows the size each item takes up in a
cargo hold.

Loading occurs after unloading, so cargo can be transferred between
ships if the player owns the planet they are on at the start of the turn.

\begin{table}[hbt]
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{lc}
    Item         &            Number of cargo units needed\\\hline
     1 unit of ore or fuel  &      1\\
     1 spacemine            &      1\\

\caption{Number of cargo units to carry items\label{cargo}}
\end{table}

\subsection{Loading Mines}%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Mines can only be loaded from the players home planet. They take up 20 cargo
units each. They can be loaded as any type that is present
and unloaded as any type (as long as that type exists
on the planet being unloaded onto).

\begin{zdchunk}
\begin{tabbing}
Syntax:\\
\hspace{\sepspace} \= S{\em xxx}L{\em yy}R{\em z} \hspace{\sepspace} \= Load {\em yy} of ore type {\em z} onto ship {\em xxx}\kill
\> S{\em xxx}L{\em yy}M{\em z} \> Load {\em yy} mines of type {\em z} onto ship {\em xxx}\\

Examples:\\
\> \verb+S306L10M4+ \> Load 10 mine type 4's onto ship 306\\
\end{tabbing}
\end{zdchunk}

\subsection{Loading PDUs}%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Each PDU takes up two cargo units. They can be loaded from any planet that is
owned by the player. More PDUs cannot be loaded from the players home planet
than have been built since the start of the game. \ie You can't remove PDUs
that were there at the start of the game. The population insist on retaining
their level of protection. If the PDUs are reduced, due to enemy attacks,
to below
the initial level (100 PDUs) they will have to built to the initial level
again before you can load any.

\begin{zdchunk}
\begin{tabbing}
Syntax:\\
\hspace{\sepspace} \= S{\em xxx}L{\em yy}R{\em z} \hspace{\sepspace} \= Load {\em yy} of ore type {\em z} onto ship {\em xxx}\kill
\> S{\em xxx}L{\em yy}D \> Load {\em yy} PDUs onto ship {\em xxx}\\

Examples:\\
\> \verb+S243L34D+ \> Load 34 PDUs onto ship 243\\
\end{tabbing}
\end{zdchunk}

\subsection{Loading Industry}%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
You can only load industry from your home planet, and like PDUs you cannot load
industry that was there at the start of the game. The planetary population
insist on retaining their standard of living. Like PDUs if the number of
industry is reduced below the initial amount (60 industry) they will have to
be built above that level before they can get loaded again. Each industry takes
10 cargo units to carry.

\begin{zdchunk}
\begin{tabbing}
Syntax:\\
\hspace{\sepspace} \= S{\em xxx}L{\em yy}R{\em z} \hspace{\sepspace} \= Load {\em yy} of ore type {\em z} onto ship {\em xxx}\kill
\> S{\em xxx}L{\em yy}I \> Load {\em yy} industry onto ship {\em xxx}\\

Examples:\\
\> \verb+S345L3I+ \> Load 3 industry onto ship 345\\
\end{tabbing}
\end{zdchunk}

\subsection{Loading Ore}%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Ore is perhaps the most common thing to carry, usually bringing ore from
the mines of your
outer planets into your inner planets for processing. Each ore takes up one
cargo unit. They can be loaded from any planet that the player owns. See
Section~\ref{earth} for details on loading ore from Earth.

\begin{zdchunk}
\begin{tabbing}
Syntax:\\
\hspace{\sepspace} \= S{\em xxx}L{\em yy}R{\em z} \hspace{\sepspace} \= Load {\em yy} of ore type {\em z} onto ship {\em xxx}\\

Examples:\\
\> \verb+S123L120R2+ \> Load 120 of ore type 2 onto ship 123\\
\end{tabbing}
\end{zdchunk}

\subsection{Loading Spacemines}%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Spacemines  can be loaded only from the  planetary  stockpile,  to
load  spacemines from active duty,  they must be undeployed  using
the Retrieve command, detailed in Section~\ref{spacemines} on spacemines.
Each spacemine takes 1 cargo unit to carry.

\begin{zdchunk}
\begin{tabbing}
Syntax:\\
\hspace{\sepspace} \= S{\em xxx}L{\em yy}R{\em z} \hspace{\sepspace} \= Load {\em yy} of ore type {\em z} onto ship {\em xxx}\kill
\> S{\em xxx}L{\em yy}S \> Load {\em yy} spacemines onto ship {\em xxx}\\

Examples:\\
\> \verb+S234L34S+ \> Load 34 spacemines onto ship 234\\
\end{tabbing}
\end{zdchunk}

\subsection{Global Loading}%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
This is like the global unload command. It
loads all the ore it can beginning with type 1 and working its way up to type
9. If the ship runs out of cargo units the loading will stop. Note that
fuel, type 0 ore, is not loaded with this command and must be loaded
separately. Global loading occurs after all other loading.

An option to global loading is to specify which ore types have priority in the
loading. After all the ores specified in the priority list have been loaded
the other ore types are loaded as before. PDUs and spacemines may also be
loaded with this option. To use this option, include after the normal global
load command the ore numbers that you wish to give priority to in the order
you wish them to be loaded in parenthesis `(' and `)'. Specify `D' or `P' for
PDUs and `S' for spacemines.

\begin{zdchunk}
\begin{tabbing}
Syntax:\\
\hspace{\sepspace} \= S{\em xxx}L{\em yy}R{\em z} \hspace{\sepspace} \= Load {\em yy} of ore type {\em z} onto ship {\em xxx}\kill
\> S{\em xxx}L \> Load ore, starting from type 1 to type 9 onto ship {\em xxx}\\
\> S{\em xxx}L({\em spec}) \> Load ore, in the order specified by {\em spec}
and then from type 1 to type 9 onto ship {\em xxx}\\

Examples:\\
\> \verb+S276L+ \> Load ore from 1 to 9 onto ship 276\\
\> \verb+S276L(78D)+ \> Load all ore 7, then all ore 8, then PDUs and then load ore from 1 to 9 onto ship 276\\
\end{tabbing}
\end{zdchunk}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Trading and Earth Contracting\label{earth}}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
     Earth is the center of the Celestial Empire galaxy, and is four
jumps away by the shortest route from every players home planet.
Earth is different from the other
planets in that it is neutral, but players may still make use of its
resources in various ways. Any player that successfully takes over Earth and
holds it for a turn
wins the game. However be warned Earth takes an active interest in its
defense. 
In order to encourage trade, Earth will remove 10\% of spacemines orbiting it
every turn during the planetary building phase.
There are a variety of options available to a player while
his or her ships orbit Earth:

\begin{itemize}
\item  Use of Earth Industry.
\item  Purchase of needed types of ore.
\item  Selling of a surplus of ore for credits.
\end{itemize}

    Note that no player may fire while on Earth, or at ships on Earth,
until turn 15 when
this  restriction is lifted;  the order will be ignored until that
turn.  Ships destroyed while over Earth, \ie stripped of
all units except the base hyperdrive unit, become neutral, but can
be towed using tractor beams to a friendly planet for refitting.
Units cannot be built onto an empty ship over Earth,
because when that ship is over Earth, it is owned by Earth.

\subsection{Earth Contracting\label{contract}}%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
    A ship may use the industry on Earth  by offering to pay
for it. The highest bidder that turn then uses as much industry as
they want to,  but the  required ore  must be  in the ship's  cargo
holds to succeed, although it can be bought from Earth in the same
turn. The ore must be in the ship being built on, not any other ship.
This is the  opposite to normal  planet operations where the
ore  must  be  on the  planet not  the  ship.   If the bid  is not
successful then nothing will be built, but no credits will be lost.
There is a minimum bid for Earth industry depending on the type of unit begin
built. This is shown at the top of the turn sheet. Any bid below the specified
amount will be ignored.  The bid is on a per industry basis, not a lump sum.

Only fighter,  cargo,  tractor and  shield units  may be built  on
Earth,  as  these  are built  onto  the ship,  not on the  planet,
everything else built would be owned  by Earth,  so such  orders
are not valid. Although you can contract for Earth industry there is
still a limit on how much industry you can use, that being the number
of industries that Earth actually has. 
If there is a high demand for Earth industry then more industries will be
automatically built to cope with the demand over time.
To pay for the use of Earth industry, you use Earth Credits, which are 
obtained by selling ore to Earth. If you do not have any of these, your
score will be deducted instead at a rate specified at the top of the turn sheet.
For example if the multiplier rate is 3 it takes 3 points of score to equal one
earth credit.

If Earth has been damaged, it reserves some of its industry and ore for its
defense, so even though there might be 50 industry left on Earth, it might
not have all 50 available for players to use.

\begin{zdchunk}
\begin{tabbing}
Syntax:\\
\hspace{\sepspace} \= S{\em xxx}B{\em yy}C{\em oz} \hspace{\sepspace} \= Bid {\em zz} credits/industry used in the building of {\em yy} cargo units onto ship {\em xxx}.\\
\> S{\em xxx}B{\em yy}F{\em zz} \> Same as above except for fighter units not cargo units.\\
\> S{\em xxx}B{\em yy}T{\em zz} \> Same as above except for tractor units not cargo units.\\
\> S{\em xxx}B{\em yy}S{\em zz} \> Same as above except for shield units not cargo units.\\

Examples: \\
\> \verb+S178B43F45+ \> Bid 45/industry to build 43 fighter units  on ship 178\\
\> \verb+S179B23C10+ \> Bid 10/industry to build 23 cargo  units  on ship 179\\
\end{tabbing}
\end{zdchunk}

\subsection{Buying Ore}%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
     If  your  empire is  short of a certain  type of  ore that is
needed,  then you can  purchase ore from Earth at a price per unit
that is  stated at the top of  the turn sheet.  This ore is loaded
directly into the cargo units of the ship that does the purchasing.
Note that you can  buy ore from the  Earth market  and build units
onto the  ship using  Earth industry in the  same turn,  this is a
very fast method of building up the size of cargo ships,  with the
number of cargo units almost doubling every turn,  other units are
not nearly as efficiently built using the resources of Earth. There are
limits to the amount of ore that can be bought from Earth, this is
shown in the turn sheet in the Earth details section under {\tt Amount}.
However if there is a demand for a certain type of ore, more mines of that
type will be be automatically built over time. Again the unit of currency in
the trade is the Earth credit.

    The ship must be over Earth to make use of this facility.
% Added 26/4/92
If Earth has been under attack, and has less than a certain number of PDUs there
could be a limited amount of some ores, as Earth reserves various ore types for
its defense.

\begin{zdchunk}
\begin{tabbing}
Syntax:\\
\hspace{\sepspace} \= S{\em xxx}P{\em yy}R{\em z} \hspace{\sepspace} \= Purchase {\em yy} units  of ore type {\em z} and load them onto ship {\em xxx} \\

Examples:\\
\> \verb+S123P12R1+ \> Buy and load 12 units of ore 1 onto ship 123\\
\end{tabbing}
\end{zdchunk}

\subsection{Selling Ore}%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
      If you have a surplus of a certain type of ore  or you need
Earth credits then you can sell  the surplus ore to the Earth
market.  The ship,  which needs to be  over Earth to sell ore must
have the ore in its  cargo hold to sell it to Earth.  The price is
$\frac{2}{3}$ that of the selling price listed on the turn sheet.
There are a number of different behaviours to selling ore to Earth.
\begin{itemize}
\item Earth will buy all ore that is sold to it. This will be indicated on the
turnsheet near the ore prices by ``Unlimited Selling''.
\item There are limits on the amount you can sell to Earth. Earth will
not buy more ore than it thinks it needs. Currently Earth thinks it needs
about 100 of each type of ore. So if Earth has 30 of ore type 0, it will not
buy more than 70 of that type of ore. This will be indicated on the turnsheet
near the ore prices by ``Limited Selling''.
\end{itemize}
This is the only way a player can get Earth credits.

There is also a global sell command which sells all ore that a ship has
except ore type 0.

\begin{zdchunk}
\begin{tabbing}
Syntax:\\
\hspace{\sepspace} \= S{\em xxx}X{\em yy}R{\em z} \= Sell {\em yy} units of ore type {\em z} from ship {\em xxx}\\
\> S{\em xxx}X \> Sell all ore except 0 from ship {\em xxx}\\

Examples:\\
\> \verb+S123X23R2+ \> Sell 23 units of ore type 2 from ship 123\\
\> \verb+S123X+ \> Sell all ore from ship 123\\
\end{tabbing}
\end{zdchunk}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Spacemines\label{spacemines}}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

     Spacemines are semi-intelligent orbiting boxes of explosives
that home in on any ship that enters the system.  However they are
only semi-intelligent and attack all ships,  whether friendly or
not.  Spacemines are less effective than PDUs,  but are easier  to
build, and can also be used in ways that PDUs can't be.

     Spacemines exist in two modes:  inactive or active.  In their
inactive  stage they are stored on the planet,  and are  harmless,
and  safe from external attack.  Active,  they are  orbiting  the
planet,  homing  in on any ships that are present in  the  system.
Spacemines automatically hit any ship that enters the system  that
they  are  in,  doing half as much damage  as  PDUs  do,  \ie  two
spacemines  are  needed  to destroy one  ship  unit.
They do not attack ships that are already in the system, or have just
been built in the system. Spacemine attacks can destroy cargo units,
unlike PDU attacks.  10\%  of  all
spacemines will be destroyed in any attack that they perform (losses are
rounded up). The spacemines suffer losses immediately when
they attack. Spacemine attacks are resolved after all
movement, so a spacemine attack will not prevent a ship from completing
its jump. They attacks ships in order of jumping, so length 1 jumps will
be affected before and jump 2 attacks and so forth.

     Spacemines  can  be  loaded  and  unloaded  directly  from  a
planetary store,  and transported to other systems where they  are
needed. They can also be deployed (put into active mode) from both
ships  and planets.  When a planet changes ownership, the planetary
stockpile is unaffected, and the new owner will inherit all of the
spacemines there. Note that you do not need to own a planet  to
deploy  spacemines from a ship into its system (see  section~\ref{strategy}
on Strategy  and
Tactics).  However spacemines can only be  undeployed  or
retrieved (put into inactive mode) by spaceships that have tractor
beams and cargo units enough to store the spacemines. It takes one
tractor unit to retrieve each spacemine,  and also one cargo  unit
to store the mine in.

Spacemines can be deployed on Earth before the attack restriction is lifted
on turn 15, however every turn that there are spacemines above Earth, 10\% of
them will be destroyed during the planetary building phase.

\begin{zdchunk}

\>   \verb+S123R23+   \>       Ship 123 retrieve 23 spacemines\\
\end{tabbing}
\end{zdchunk}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Battle\label{battle}}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
All  battle  is  simultaneous.  A ship may  attack spacemines, mines, industry,
PDUs or other ships. The ships may attack multiple targets in the same system in
the same turn, but may only use each fighter unit once per turn. If the number
of fighter units is not specified in an attack command, all fighter units are
assumed to be used.

Some targets, like
mines, take multiple shots to destroy; if not enough shots are received per
attack
then no damage is done. For example, it takes 10 shots to destroy a mine.
If the mine took 9 shots in a turn from a single ship it would not be affected.
If another ship came and did another 9 shots to it, it would still not be
destroyed. Fractional damage amounts are not kept from turn to turn. Normal
maintenance repairs the damage inflicted during the turn. If your ship initiates
combat, it cannot then jump on its own, however it can still be engaged by
tractor units from another ship.

\subsection{Shot Calculation}%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
To calculate the damage your ship will do:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Calculate the mass of the ship\footnote{
Where $ecu$ is the number of empty cargo units, $fcu$ is the number of full
cargo units, $fu$ is the number of fighter units, $tu$ is the number of tractor units, and $su$ is the number of
shield units.}.
      \[ Mass=1+(ecu)+1.5*(fcu)+(tu)/2+(su)/2+(fu)/10.\]

For example a ship has 102 fighter units, 20 cargo units,
10 of which are full, 10 tractor units, and 20 shield units\footnote{
This is a very powerful and expensive ship, a Super Battleship.}.
Its mass is:
\[1+10+1.5*10+10/2+20/2+102/10=51.2\]
\item Calculate the ratio between the number of fighter units used in the 
attack and the mass of the ship. In the above example $Ratio=\frac{102}{51.2}\approx 2.0$
\item Cross reference this number to get shots per fighter  unit
from Figure~\ref{ratio}. In this example it is around 1.25
% Added footnote 26/4/92 for those without latex capabilities
\footnote{For those of you who want the precise details the vertices of the
graph are at $(0,0)$, $(1,1)$, $(10,3)$ and $(16,3)$.}.
\item Calculate the number of shots fired by the ship.  Multiply
the  number  of  shots fired per fighter unit  by  the  number  of
fighter  units and round down to a whole number.  So  our  example
ship will have $1.25\times102=127.5$ rounded down to 127 shots.

\end{center}
\caption{Graph of shots/fighter unit vs mass ratio\label{ratio}}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Ship Design}%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
The number of shots that a combat ship can apply depends on many factors.
The mass is one of the most important factors. Shield units are
useful but they mass a fair bit. Also try and reduce the number of cargo units
that the ship will have, it needs a few if it is to be mobile.  Tractor units
are not very useful for battle-ships as they mass too much in the large numbers
that you need them in, it is better to have a dedicated battleship and a
cargo vessel that has lots of tractor units.
One of the skills in Celestial Empire is the ability to design ships
that are useful in a wide range of areas, and have little or no weakness.

For a cargo ship mass does not matter, they are going to mass heaps and
have very low shot ratios if you bother putting fighter units on them. However
shield units are very useful for cargo vessels, as the mass does not matter,
and it allows a heavily laden cargo ship to get past enemy raiders.
\vspace{3ex}

     There are five types of targets:
\subsection{Ships}%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
     Ships are unpredictable targets.  You know the type of  ship,
but you never know exactly how big the target ship is. For details
on this see the section~\ref{shiptypes} on ship types.
The targeted ship does not
lose  the  ability  to  move  unless  the  attack  has   destroyed
sufficient cargo units to make it impossible to carry the required
fuel. Each  shield unit will absorb a number of shots depending on the
proportion of units that are shields, as shown in Figure~\ref{f-shields}%
\footnote{Vertices are $(0,1)$,$(20,2)$, and $(90,4)$.}.
If there  are  any
excess, each shot will destroy a shield unit until there are  none,
and then destroy fighter units until there are none. If there are
still any shots left the tractor units start to be destroyed  and
finally  cargo units are removed, all for one  shot/unit. The
hyperdrive/hull unit cannot be destroyed. If the ship, after being
attacked, does not have sufficient cargo units to hold all  its
cargo, the excess is unloaded onto the  planet, starting with
% 2/5/92 Added footnote
mines\footnote{These mines will be randomly distributed amongst the mines
that exist on the planet below. If there are no mines on that planet, then
these mines will be destroyed}, industry, PDUs, spacemines, then ore from
type 9 down to type 0. However spacemines released in this way do not end up
on the planet like everything else, they end up orbiting the planet,
\ie they are deployed.

\caption{Graph of shots absorbed per shield unit\label{f-shields}}
\end{figure}

You cannot attack a ship that is owned by a player you consider FRIENDLY.
However that does not stop them attacking you if you are NEUTRAL or HOSTILE
in their eyes. Also your ship cannot attack itself, but can attack other
ships owned by you, for whatever nefarious reasons you may wish to do this.

When you attack a ship you will get a report in your command history of how
much damage that ship had done to it that turn, and how much of it you did.
Likewise if your ship is damaged, you will be told how much damage it took, and
what effect it had.

\begin{zdchunk}
\begin{tabbing}
Syntax:\\
\hspace{\sepspace} \= S{\em xxx}AS{\em yyy} \hspace{\sepspace} \= Ship {\em xxx} attack ship {\em yyy} with all fighter units\\
\> S{\em xxx}A{\em zz}S{\em yyy} \> Ship {\em xxx} attack ship {\em yyy} with {\em zz} fighter units\\

Examples:\\
\> \verb+S231AS321+ \> Ship 231 attack ship 321\\
\> \verb+S231A34S321+ \> Ship 231 attack ship 321 with 32 fighter units.
\end{tabbing}
\end{zdchunk}

\subsection{Planetary Defense Units}%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
     The  PDUs  on a planet must be removed before  ownership  can
change,  unless it is gifted away by the owner. This is the normal
reason for attacking them. PDUs can be ordered to attack ships only
if the owner of those ships is considered hostile in the formal alliance table.

When a ship that does not belong to the player or to one of their formal
allies, jumps {\em through} a planet that has PDUs defending it, the PDUs
will automatically fire upon that ship. A ship that finishes its turn
on the planet will not be fired upon automatically.

     When attacked, PDUs will fire at each attacking ship. Each PDU
will destroy units as for ship to ship combat. The number of shots each PDU
generates is a function of how many PDUs there are on that planet, as shown in
Figure~\ref{f-pdus}.
This occurs simultaneously, so the ship will
attack with its full strength at the same time that the PDUs attack at their
full strength. However at the end of the turn both will be damaged.
Each three shots from a ship will destroy one PDU.

When you attack PDUs you will be told in your command history how many you
destroyed. The player whose planet they were around will also be told how
many you destroyed.

\begin{zdchunk}
\begin{tabbing}
Syntax:\\
\hspace{\sepspace} \= S{\em xxx}AD \hspace{\sepspace} \= Ship {\em xxx} attack PDUs\\
\> S{\em xxx}A{\em zz}D \> Ship {\em xxx} attack PDUs with {\em zz} fighter units\\

Examples:\\
\> \verb+S309AD+ \> Ship 309 attack PDUs\\
\> \verb+S309A2D+ \> Ship 309 attack PDUs with 2 fighter units\\
\end{tabbing}
\end{zdchunk}

\subsection{Mines}%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
     To attack a mine the firing ship must specify the mine  type.
It takes 10 shots to destroy 1 mine. The PDUs on the planet  will
react as if they had been attacked and will attack the  ship
at the same time that it attacks the mine. If there are some
shots  left  after  all  the  mines  of  the  specified  type  are
destroyed,  stored  ore  of  that type will be  destroyed  at  one
unit/shot.

When you attack mines you will be told in your command history how many you
destroyed, as well as how much ore. The player whose planet they were around
will also be told how many you destroyed.

\begin{zdchunk}
\begin{tabbing}
Syntax:\\
\hspace{\sepspace} \= S{\em xxx}AMy \hspace{\sepspace} \= Ship {\em xxx} attack mine type {\em y}\\
\> S{\em xxx}A{\em zz}My \> Ship {\em xxx} attack mine type {\em y} with {\em zz} fighter units\\

Examples:\\
\> \verb+S165AM0+ \> Ship 165 attack mine type 0\\
\> \verb+S165A10M0+ \> Ship 165 attack mine type 0 with 10 fighter units\\
\end{tabbing}
\end{zdchunk}

\subsection{Ore}%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
     To attack ore the firing ship must specify the ore type.
The PDUs on the planet  will
react as if they had been attacked and will attack the  ship
at the same time that it attacks the ore. If there are some
shots  left  after  all  the  ore  of  the  specified  type  have been
destroyed,  the shots are wasted. It takes one shot to destroy one unit of
ore.

\begin{zdchunk}
\begin{tabbing}
Syntax:\\
\hspace{\sepspace} \= S{\em xxx}ARy \hspace{\sepspace} \= Ship {\em xxx} attack ore type {\em y}\\
\> S{\em xxx}A{\em zz}Ry \> Ship {\em xxx} attack ore type {\em y} with {\em zz} fighter units\\

Examples:\\
\> \verb+S165AM0+ \> Ship 165 attack ore type 0\\
\> \verb+S165A10M0+ \> Ship 165 attack ore type 0 with 10 fighter units\\
\end{tabbing}
\end{zdchunk}
\subsection{Industry}%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
     The  same rules apply for industry as for  mines,  except  of
course there's no need to specify type,  and all excess shots  are
wasted.

\begin{zdchunk}
\begin{tabbing}

\subsection{Spacemines}%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
     Ships  with  fighter  units can attack  spacemines  that  are
active around a planet.  Spacemines that are stockpiled cannot  be
attacked  by  ships,  or  by any other  means.  One  spacemine  is
destroyed per shot. You will be told how many you destroyed, as will the
owner of the planet.

\subsection{Planetary Attacks vs Ships}%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
     If you  have listed another  player as Hostile on  the formal
alliances, your PDUs can, if you so direct, fire at his ship, when it
has stopped over the planet.  This attack form will not work
if the player who owns the ship is not listed as Hostile. 
The more PDUs are in the attack the more shots they do per PDU. For the exact
amount see Figure~\ref{f-pdus}\footnote{The vertices on this graph are
$(0,1)$,$(20,2)$,$(100,3)$,$(500,4)$.}.  See above for details on
the power of a single shot.

When you attack a ship you will get a report in your command history of how
much damage that ship had done to it that turn, and how much of it you did.
Likewise if your ship is damaged, you will be told how much damage it took, and
what effect it had.

\end{tabbing}
\end{zdchunk}

\subsection{Planetary Attacks vs Spacemines}%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
If some other player, or even yourself has deployed spacemines around your
planet, and you want to get rid of them before your ship jumps into the
system, you can get your PDUs to fire upon the spacemines, destroying one
spacemine for every PDU. You will be told in your command history how many
were destroyed.

\end{tabbing}
\end{zdchunk}

\subsection{Earth attacking Enemy Ships}%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Once a player has fired upon Earth that player is listed as hostile by
NEUTRAL. That player will, from then on, be attacked by any neutral planet that
has PDUs that have not been fired yet. This is after all normal attacks.

Note that this happens even if you do not put a turn in, so if you attack
Earth be careful.

\section{Ship Tending\label{tend}}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Sometimes you need to move cargo from one ship to another without first
unloading it on the planet below, usually when you do not own the planet below.
To do this you give a tend command, telling one ship to transfer cargo into
another ships cargo hold. Naturally you can only do this to your own ships, or
those of your allies. At the moment if two ships try to tend to each other with
the same type of unit (ore, mines, industry, etc.) it is undefined which will
occur first, so if you have no free space on your ships your order could fail
due to lack of space.

\section{Unbuilding\label{unbuilding}}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
The owner of a ship can remove units from a ship to change the profile of the
ship, and also to recover the ore used in their construction. It takes the
same amount of industry to destroy units as it does to create them in the
first place, however not all the ore is recovered, half of the ore is lost in
the process, rounded down. The order syntax is shown below, `Z' was chosen
basically because all the other nice letters had been taken. Just think of
`Z' for zap.

Only ship units can be unbuilt. Mines, industry, spacemines, PDUs and
hyperdrives cannot be unbuilt.

\begin{table}[hbt]

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Building\label{building}}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
     The owner of a planet may order the planet to build items  if
the planet has enough industry and ore.  The ore is consumed, the industry
is not, however an `industry' can only be used once per turn.
Table~\ref{build} contains all the relevant information for building.

For  example  if a planet had 60 industry it could be  ordered  to
build 1 hyperdrive with 8 cargo units,  1 industry and 2 PDUs,  if
it had the required ore\footnote{This build order would need 8 units of
type 1 ore, 12 type 4, 10 each of types 5, 6 and 7, and 5 each of types 8 and
9 on the planet doing the building.}.

If you try to build using more than you have of industry or ore, the amount you
will build will be reduced to the amount that can be produced. For example,
if you tell a planet to build 20 mine 3s and it only has ore for 5 mines, then
only 5 mines will be produced. With hyperdrives, only whole units will be built,
so if you ask for 3 hyperdrives, each with 10 fighter units, and you have
enough ore for only 25 fighter units, but enough for the three actual
hyperdrives themselves, then only two hyperdrives will be built, both with
10 fighter units on them. A hyperdrive with only 5 units will NOT be produced.

\begin{table}[hbt]
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{cccc}
Item & Amount of each type & Types needed & Number of Industry\\\hline
cargo unit            &  1     &        1      &       1 \\
fighter unit          &  1     &        2,3    &       2\\

\subsection{Planetary Building}%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
You can build industry, mines, PDUs, spacemines and hyperdrives on planets.
You do not need to have a ship on the planet to do any of this building, just
the ore and the industry. You can build mines on a planet even if there are
not any mines of that type there at the moment.

Note that spacemines use any sort of ore, the type being specified
in the order to build.

\end{tabbing}
\end{zdchunk}

\subsection{Shipboard Building}%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Shipboard units: fighter, cargo, tractor
and  shield units must be built directly onto ships --- they  cannot
be  stockpiled  on  a planet,  and cannot be  built  onto  another
player's ships.  The orders to build these units begin with an  `S'
and the ship number that they are being built on. The ore required has to
be on the planet, not in the ship's cargo hold. The exception to this is
contracting units on Earth, see section~\ref{contract} for details.

\begin{zdchunk}

\hspace{\sepspace} \= S{\em xxx}B{\em yy}C \hspace{\sepspace} \= Ship {\em xxx} build {\em yy} cargo units\\

\end{zdchunk}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Movement\label{movement}}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
     If  a  ship  has enough fuel (type 0 ore) it  can  jump  from
planet to planet if the order can be written,  \ie if you know the
correct planet numbers.  There are two ways to find out the planet
number --- visit the planet,  or ask another player (or a  research
planet). Trading in information is common. A ship can jump as many
as  5 planets in one turn by listing the intermediate planets  and
the  final planet.  The fuel requirements are listed  in Table~\ref{jump}. 
Note that  fuel  must be carried by the cargo units  of  the  ship. 
If another  ship  that has successfully engaged  yours  with  tractor
beams, you will follow it through the jumps, but at no expenditure
of fuel, even if you wish to jump elsewhere. Your ship cannot jump
if it initiated battle, either against another ship or a planet.

The fuel used in long jumps (greater than 1) is dependent
on the efficiency of the drive.  The initial efficiency is 0.
The only way to increase the efficiency of a drive unit is
using a  research planet  order.  The ship must  be on the  planet
during the research turn.  See section~\ref{research} on research planets
for more details.  The amount of fuel used  for the length of jump and
the efficiency of the drive is given in Table~\ref{jump}. Note that
the maximum effective efficiency is 4, but the drives efficiency can exceed
4. When a ship is stripped of all its units, to
become a hull, its drive efficiency remains what it was. This is because the
hull/hyperdrive unit is indestructible, and not affected by the attack.

Effective efficiency is modified by the size of the ship.
For every 200 units the
ship has, apart from the first 200, the effective efficiency goes down by 1.
A ship can have an effective efficiency of -1 and still move, however it
will be expensive in fuel costs. If the effective efficiency goes below -1
the ship will not be able to move. For example if a ship has an efficiency
of 1, and has 100 units, its effective efficiency will still be 1; if the
same ship had 210 units, its effective efficiency would be 0.

If you specify a multiple jump and the ship can only jump part of the way,
for example if you got one of the intermediary planet numbers wrong, the
ship will jump as far as it is able along the route specified, but will use
fuel as if it had completed the jump. If the jump cannot be started, \ie you
got the first planet wrong, no fuel will be lost.

\begin{table}[hbt]
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{lc|cccccc}
\multicolumn{7}{c}{Drive Efficiency}\\\hline
      &   & -1 &  0 & 1  & 2  & 3  & 4+\\\hline
      & 1 & 2  &  1 & 1  & 1  & 1  & 1\\
    J & 2 & 8  &  4 & 2  & 2  & 2  & 2\\
    U & 3 & 18 &  9 & 6  & 3  & 3  & 3\\

    P & 5 & 50 & 25 & 20 & 15 & 10 & 5\\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\caption{Fuel requirements for jumping\label{jump}}
\end{table}

     As  you  jump through a system in a  multiple  jump,  if  the
planets  you  jump through are not owned by you and have  PDUs  on
them, then the PDUs will fire on your ship in the normal manner  as
if  you attacked them,  but you cannot fire  back.  If a player
has {\em you} listed as friendly in the formal alliance table then
the PDUs will not fire in this manner. However if they have you listed as
neutral or hostile they will fire at you.

     If  a  planet  has  spacemines they  will  attack  your  ship
independent  of which player you are,  even if you own the  planet
you will be attacked.  If you go on a multiple jump, spacemines on
any of the intervening planets will also attack your ship. The attacks
by the spacemines are resolved at the end of the turn. See
section~\ref{spacemines} for details.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Ore Transmutation\label{trans}}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
If you desperately need ore of a specific type and you have an excess of
industry you can transmute one sort of an ore into another sort. This is
expensive in industry, but if you need the ore, or have industry surplus to 
your needs it can be worth while. 

It takes 10 industry to transmute 1 unit of ore from one type to another.

\hspace{\sepspace} \= {\em xxx}X{\em yy}R{\em z}R{\em w} \hspace{\sepspace} \= Planet {\em xxx} transmute {\em yy} ore type {\em z} into type {\em w}\\

\end{tabbing}
\end{zdchunk}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Planet Scans\label{scans}}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
     Your home planet is able to obtain information on one  planet
per  turn,  each research planet is also able to provide one  scan
per  turn.  The  information  you get is exactly  what  you  would
receive if you had a ship on the planet. When a planet is scanned,
by either you or someone else, everyone who has an interest in that
planet (\ie owns it, has a ship above it, or is scanning it) will see
that it is being scanned by having the following line appear above the
planet in the turn sheet:

\begin{verbatim}
             *******  PLANET SCANNED THIS TURN *******
\end{verbatim}

\begin{zdchunk}
\begin{tabbing}
Syntax:\\
\hspace{\sepspace} \= SCAN{\em xxx} \hspace{\sepspace} \= Scan planet number {\em xxx}\\

\> \verb+SCAN123+ \> Scan planet 123\\
\end{tabbing}
\end{zdchunk}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Standing Orders\label{standing}}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
A standing order can be given to each planet and ship that the player owns.
This order will be treated like a standard player order, but will be executed 
every turn, even if the player does not put in a turn sheet for that turn.
Only orders that directly concern the planet or ship in question can be
given (\ie No changing alliances or scanning using standing orders is allowed).
The standing orders will be included in the players COMMAND HISTORY along with
all the commands that the player gave that turn.

Standing orders will not be executed the turn they are set but the next turn, 
and every turn thereafter until they are turned off. The syntax for setting
a standing order is the same as doing a normal order except precede the 
commands with an `O'. To clear a standing order just put an `X' in front of
the ship or planet name. The order will not be cleared until the turn after the
order is given. \ie When the clear order is given the standing order will still
be executed that turn.

Note that no syntax checking of the order is done until the command is executed
in the following turns, so if you get the order wrong you will get an error
message every turn until you change the standing order.

The standing orders will be executed before they are cleared in the same turn,
due to them being placed after they are executed. \ie If you have a planets
standing order to building industry, and then set it to build PDUs, it will
still build industry on the turn you tell it to change its standing order.

Standing orders are cleared when ownership changes.

\begin{zdchunk}
\begin{tabbing}
Syntax:\\
\hspace{\sepspace} \= OS{\em xxx}{\em order} \hspace{\sepspace} \= Set the standing order of ship {\em xxx} to {\em order}\\
\> O{\em xxx}{\em order} \> Set the standing order of planet {\em xxx} to {\em order}\\
\> XS{\em xxx}\> Clear standing order for ship {\em xxx}\\
\> X{\em xxx} \> Clear the standing order for planet {\em xxx}\\

Examples:\\
\> \verb+OS123AI+ \> Set a standing order for ship 123 to attack industry every turn\\
\> \verb+O234B3D+ \> Set the standing order for planet 234 to build 3 PDUs every
turn\\
\> \verb+XS123+ \> Clear ship 123's standing order\\
\> \verb+X234+ \> Clear the standing order for planet 234\\
\end{tabbing}
\end{zdchunk}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Change of Ownership\label{ownership}}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
     Ownership of a planet is determined automatically at the  end
of the turn, there is no need to do it formally.

     Spacemines do not affect ownership in any way,  planets  that
have spacemines deployed will change their ownership by the normal
methods specified below.

\subsection{Planet Ownership}%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Ownership of planet cannot change while there are PDUs  on
it (unless gifted away). If there are no PDU, the ownership:
\begin{itemize}
  \item is unchanged if there are no ships on the planet, or
  \item changes to the player who owns the ship if there is  only
one ship there as long as it is not an {\bf empty hull},
  \item is unchanged if more than one player has a ship there.
\end{itemize}
Before any player has visited a planet, it is neutral,  and for the
purposes of this section the planet can be considered to belong to
another player called NEUTRAL. If two players land on a previously
unclaimed  planet  in the same turn,  it continues to  be  neutral
until  there is only one player's ship there and there are no  PDU
on  the  planet.  If  a player drops PDU on a  neutral  planet  it
becomes an armed neutral planet.  Also,  it is possible to gift  a
planet to NEUTRAL.

% Added 26/4/92
When a player takes over a planet a message will appear in the 
command history: ``{\tt Planet 102 liberated from PsiNinja}''. The
player who lost the planet will get ``{\tt Planet 102 defeated by 
Space Attack}''. You are not told who took your planet, you have to
that yourself with scans or moving a ship over that planet.

    To summarize,  a planet will  only change ownership if you are
the only player  with ships over  a planet that is not defended by
PDUs. Empty hulls do not count as ships for this purposes. Gifting
is the only other way to change ownership of a planet.

    Most of the planets owned by NEUTRAL are unarmed, less then 5\%
have  PDUs  on them  at  the start  of the game.  Earth is  always
defended, and will rebuild its defences if it is attacked.

\subsection{Ship Ownership} %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Ownership of ships which have not been gifted is:
\begin{itemize}
      \item unchanged if any units remain on the hull.
      \item changed to the player who owns the planet the ship is on if
the ship is just a hull.
\end{itemize}

    Ownership  of a  ship with any  units on it  is not changeable
except by  gifting.  A hull (\ie  a ship with no units) belongs to
the owner of the planet it is orbiting around. Hulls will not affect the
ownership of the planet however. 
% Added 26/4/92
When a ship changes ownership the person
who now owns it gets the message ``{\tt Ship S103 has been boarded by your
space marines}'' while the original owner gets ``{\tt Ship S103 lost to space
pirates}''.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Mining\label{mining}}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
     Most planets have some mines of several different types. Each
mine  of each type will produce 1 unit of ore per  turn.  This  is
automatic and requires no orders from the player.  Neutral planets
will  not produce ore --- a planet must be owned by a player  before
its mines will produce. The exception to this rule is Earth, which produces
all the time. Spacemines do not produce anything, except casualties.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Research Planets\label{research}}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
     About  10\% of all planets are Research  Planets.  These  have
various  effects on the game.  The player who owns  them  receives
additional credits as shown in section~\ref{score}.  Also on turn  10
and every 4 turns thereafter,  each research planet will allow its
owner to choose one of the benefits listed below.  Also they
allow  more planet scans, which are described in section~\ref{scans}.
Finally, after every research turn a list of the owners and nearby planets
will appear  on the turn sheet sent to the players. This list contains all
research planets that were owned at the end of the research planet turn,
irrespective of whether they were used that turn or not.
Available benefits:
\begin{itemize}
\item Creation  of a permanent link between two  planets,  both  of
which  are owned by the player giving the order,  and  neither  of
them having four connecting planets already
\item Building of four cargo units with four units of fuel  already
loaded onto a ship at the research planet.
\item Creation of an industry on the research planet.
\item Creation of a mine,  regardless of the existence
of mines of that type on the research planet.
% Added 12/5/92
\item Creation of 10 PDUs on the research planet, or 5 on another planet.
\item Transmutation  of  ore.  This  can be done  in  fairly  large
quantities. 100 units of ore on the research planet, and about 25 for not on
the research planet. Only a single ore type can be done per research planet.
\item Transmutation of mines. Two mines on the research planet can be converted
to mines of a different type. One mine off the research planet can be converted.
% Added 10/5/92
\item Changing of mines to industry or vice versa. If the mines and industry are
on the research planet, 3 mines can be converted to 2 industry, or 3 industry
can be converted to 2 mines. Off the research planet, 2 mines can be converted
to 1 industry, or 2 industry can be converted to one mine. Note that this 
cannot be used to reduce your home planets industry below its initial level.
\item Random positioning of one of your ships. Note that random means getting
the dice out, you have no control over where your ship will end up. Your ship
does not have to start on the research planet.
\item Specific positioning of a ship onto an either neutral or planet owned by
you. It does not have to be on a research planet, but it cannot be on another
players planet. This takes TWO research planets in the same turn.
\item Loading one unit of fuel onto another player's ship.
\item About  50\%  increase in the number of units of any type  on  a
ship on the research planet, or about 20\% increase for one off the
research planet. If an industry is sacrificed on the research planet, at
the start of a research planet turn, then an extra 10\% increase per industry
in either of these figures, to a maximum of 100\%. Note that the industry can
be on a ship above the research planet as well as on the planet.
There will be a minimum growth of 5 units unless specified. There is also a 
maximum rate of increase, no ships units can more than double in a single turn,
no matter how many research planets you use. Research planets can only
increase the number of units upto 250. Any units beyond this will be ignored.
\item Decrease in the number on units on one of your ships. The rate of
decrease is double that of unit increase. \ie 100\% decrease for a ship on the
research planet, 40\% for a ship off the research planet. If you want a lesser
number destroyed remember to write it clearly on your turn sheet.
\item Transferring units from one ship to another; 30 units if both ships are
over the research planet, or 20 if only one is over the research planet, or 10
if neither ship are over the research planet.
\item Details of another player's ships --- you are told the number of
each type, {\em not} the specific unit numbers, locations, cargo etc.
\item Details on ownership of planets, \ie Who owns how many planets.
\item Destruction  of  a link.  The player must  own  both  planets
involved,  must have a battleship on each planet and must have  at
least two industries on one of the planets.  the  two  industries
will  be destroyed in the process of destroying  the  link.
\item Increase  the  drive  efficiency  of  a  ship that  is on the
research planet at the start of the research turn.
\item Moving a ship around (by teleport) without using fuel. The range that it
can move is 4 if the ship is on a research planet, 2 if it is not. This cannot
move a ship over or through space not controlled by you. Please give the path
that you want the ship to take. Note that the ship cannot end up on a planet
that you do not own. Also no planets that you pass through can have either
deployed spacemines or non-aligned ships on them. You can still start your
ship at an enemy controlled planet however.
\item Converting one sort of unit to another on a single ship. This can be done
in unlimited amounts. The ratio of units changed will be different depending
on what units you are changing from and to. For example 3 shield units will
be converted to 2 fighter units, or if the ship is not on the research planet
then 3 shield units get converted to 1 fighter unit.
For cargo to fighters the ratio is 4 to 1, cargo to shields 3 to 1.
\item Transporting two industry or mines from a research planet to a ship.
Or transporting one industry or mine from another planet to a ship. In either
case the ship must be orbiting the planet where the mines or industry are.
\item As  requested  by a player.  The  following  restraints  must
apply:
\begin{itemize}
     \item   The  request  must  be  physically  realistic,   and  be
possible to implement in the game.
     \item   It must not be too powerful, anything more powerful than
a 50\% increase in fighter units will probably not be allowed.
     \item   It cannot create new game elements.  The effects must be
instantaneous.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

     When giving research planet orders please be clear. Note that
these orders are carried out before any others so ships must be on
the  research planet at the end of the previous turn if they  wish
to use some of the ship based options on the research planet turn.
If you want a special request, mail it in early so that I can
discuss it with you, otherwise just mail me your requests with your
normal commands. Be sure to say which planet is doing which request.

The actual syntax of these orders is open as they are human read, not
machine read. Place the research orders at or near the top of the turn
sheet in a comment. For example:
\begin{verbatim}
;RP103 Increase efficiency of S100
\end{verbatim}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Diplomacy\label{diplo}}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
To communicate with other players there are various sorts of message
facilities available. These messages should be included in the turn sheet just
like any other command. 

There are three sorts of message:
\begin{description}
\item[Global Messages] The message gets sent to all players in the game.
\item[Personal Messages] This message gets sent to just one player.
\item[Alliance Messages] This message will be sent to people who are of the
same alliance status to you. So you can send messages to all people who are
your allies, friends, enemies etc.
\end{description}
Each message must be only
one line long. If you want to send a message longer than one line send
multiple messages, the order will be preserved. Having a terminator at the end
of the line is optional but recommended.

\begin{zdchunk}
\begin{tabbing}
Syntax:\\
\hspace{\sepspace} \= \& {\em playername} {\em personal message} [\&] \hspace{2 \sepspace} \= Send {\em personal message}\kill
\> \{ {\em broadcast message} [\}] \> Send {\em message} to every player.\\
\> \&{\em playername} {\em personal message} [\&] \> Send {\em personal message}
to {\em playername}.\\
\> ({\em allnce} {\em allnce msg} [)] \> Send {\em allnce msg} to
all players who you have at {\em allnce} status.\\

Examples:\\
\> \verb+{Death to Grok the infidel.}+ \> Send
``\verb+Death to Grok the infidel.+'' to every player.\\
\> \verb+&Winter Leave #306 now or face war.&+ \> Send
``\verb+Leave #306 now or face war+'' to Winter.\\
\> \verb+(ALLY We must strike at P304 now)+ \> Send ``\verb+We must

\end{tabbing}
\end{zdchunk}

\section{Ship Types\label{shiptypes}}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
     Another  player's ships will not appear on your  printout  in
the same detail as your own ships.  The only information you  will
be  given is the type of ship that it is,  as well as its  number,
name  and  who  the owner is.  Ships  are  divided  into  classes
according  to  the number of fighter and cargo  units  they  have.
Shield and tractor units have no effect. Table~\ref{types} lists
all ship types.

\begin{table}[hbt]
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{rlll}
Ship Type     &   F-units  &C-units & Ratio (fighter:cargo units)\\\hline
Empty Ship    &     0      &  0        & na\\

\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\caption{Ship Types\label{types}}
\end{table}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Tractor Beams\label{tractors}}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
     Tractor  beams may be used to capture and tow ships.  If  the
tractors are successfully attached,  the target ship will  accompany
the towing ship when it moves, for no extra cost in fuel. They can
also be used in the retrieval of spacemines from active duty.

     To  determine if tractor beams will engage  successfully  the
following rules must be followed.
\begin{itemize}
     \item   The engaging ship must have equal or greater tractor units
 than  the target  ship has mass,  using the same formula as in  the  battle
section.
     \item  A  ship  which  is engaged by  one  ship  cannot  engage
another, \ie no daisy chaining.
     \item If two ships engage the same target,  the ship with  the
most tractor units wins.
\end{itemize}

     A  ship can only attach its tractor beams to  one  ship.  The
target  ship  is then prevented from moving,  or  tractor  beaming
another ship. The tractor beams disengage at the end of the turn.

\begin{zdchunk}
\begin{tabbing}
Syntax:\\
\hspace{\sepspace} \= S{\em xxx}ES{\em yyy} \hspace{\sepspace} \= Ship {\em xxx} engage ship {\em yyy} with tractor beams.\\

Examples:\\
\> \verb+S123ES234+ \> Ship 123 attempt to engage ship 234 with tractor beams\\
\end{tabbing}
\end{zdchunk}

     Tractor beams can only be used to engage ships or retrieve
spacemines, not both. When retrieving spacemines, the tractor
beams automatically succeed in locking on. It takes one tractor
beam for every spacemine, as well as the cargo unit to hold the
spacemine. See the section on spacemines for more details.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Score\label{score}}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Score is one of the ways to win the game.
The score you have and that all the other players have is listed at the
top of the turn sheet as shown in section~\ref{exheader}.
Table~\ref{income} lists the returns from various items.

\begin{table}[hbt]
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ll}
     Item           &Return (Credits/turn)\\\hline
     mine              & 1\\
     industry          & 5\\
     planet            & 20\\
     1 research planet & 1 (in addition to everything else)\\
     2 research planets & 16\\
     3 research planets & 81\\
    4+ research planets & 256\\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\caption{Income gained\label{income}}
\end{table}

For example a planet has 12 mines and 3 industry on it. Its income would be
\[ 20+12+3\times 5=47 \]
The bonus for the research planets is on an empire basis, so a planet being
a research planet does not increase its own income, just that of the empire
that it belongs to.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Further Improvements\label{improve}}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
     The  game  administrator  is  open  to  discussion  for   any
improvements  that  you  might  have  thought  of.  They  will  be
implemented,  if  everyone  approves, as soon  as  possible  in  the
current game, and in all subsequent games.

Current improvements on the drawing board include:
\begin{itemize}
     \item  Space patrol vessels wandering through the galaxy  slowly,
who attack any one who attacks Earth, but otherwise do little.
     \item Having the chance to hit ships in combat vary with the size
of the ship.
     \item  Automatic  retaliation if a ship does not have  an  attack
order and is itself attacked.
    \item A system where players can trade with one another, rather than just
Earth.
    \item Change the way players buy ore at Earth to a bidding system like
contracting where the current price is the minimum bid.
\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Adjusting Game Length\label{gamelength}}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
There are three different lengths to the game
\begin{itemize}
\item The game is over when one of the winning conditions is met. The player
or players who meet the winning conditions are the winners, as are their
allies.
\item The game is over after a number of turns specified at the start of the
game. The player with the most of a certain resource at the end of the game,
such as score or credits is the winner, as are their allies.
\item The game is over after a number of turns specified by the players
themselves. This number can change from turn to turn.
When this number of turns is completed the player with the most of a
certain resource, such as score or credits is the winner, as are their allies.
\end{itemize}

In the last case each player can issue a turn command to adjust the length of
the game. The program will take each players desired turn length and produce a
compromise between them, which will be displayed with the players current
desired turn at the top of the turn sheet. This means that a player who has
got a good score or whatever, and knows that noone has a better score, will
put the turn low, so as to try and win sooner, while someone with a low score
will put the turn high to give them time to build up their score. There are
minimum and maximum limits to the desired ending turn, at the moment these are
10 and 100 respectively.

\begin{zdchunk}
\begin{tabbing}
Syntax:\\
\hspace{\sepspace} \= TURN {\em xx} \hspace{\sepspace} \= Finish the game on
turn {\em xx}.\\

Examples:\\
\> \verb+TURN30+ \> Finish the game on turn 30.\\
\end{tabbing}
\end{zdchunk}

\begin{itemize}
\item Shields are scaled according to the percentage of the ship that are
shields.
\item Fighters now have mass, shields now weigh half as much.
\item PDUs get more shots each the more there are of them.
\item Further restrictions and clarifications for research planet orders.
\item PDUs no longer fire on empty hulls.
\item Changed the documentation to use inline gnuplot commands.
\end{itemize}

The following changes have been made to the game and/or documentation since
version 1.45.
\begin{itemize}
\item Internal change in code, changing NEUTRAL to plr0 rather than plr9.
\item Income and Earth credits are now winning conditions.
\item Planets are given an name on galaxy creation.
\item There are now two modes to selling ore on Earth. Unlimited, where all
ore can be sold at once, or Limited, where Earth will only buy a limited
amount of ore.
\item In certain games the players can change the game length themselves each
turn.
\item The ship types have been changed around and rationalized.
\end{itemize}

\section{Turn Sheet Example\label{turnexample}}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

There may be some small discrepancies between the example turn sheet shown
here and the one that the game sends out. This is due to constant improvements
in the turn sheet format and the details of the game. If you find a major
discrepancy please mail the author.

\subsection{Header\label{exheader}}%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
This section contains the basic information about the game, like turn number,
date that
the turn sheet has to be mailed back, where they must be mailed to.
The scores of the players are read across so player 2s score is 1660.
Winning conditions are listed here, make sure that you know what you are aiming
for when you play the game. ``{\tt Earth}'' means that you need to take earth
for a turn to win, the others should be fairly self explanatory. If one of the
conditions such as ``{\tt score}'' does not appear in the list it means that it
is not part of the winning conditions.
The minimum bid accepted by Earth for each of the different unit types is also
listed. Bids below these amounts will not be accepted.
Also listed is the number of scans that you have this turn.

\subsection{Ship Summary}%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
This is a summary of all the player's ships. It shows all the details of the
ships. What units they have, their name, where they are, and what cargo they
have loaded. The number in brackets after the number of cargo units is the
number of empty cargo units. The number in brackets after the number of shield
units is the number of shots that the ship will absorb before taking damage.
The number in brackets after the efficiency is the effective efficiency.

\subsection{Planet summary}%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
This is a summary of all the player's planets. It shows the amount of ore
stored on each planet and its production, as well as the number of PDUs and
industry there. The first number in each column is the production(\ie the
number of mines of that type) of the ore on that planet. After the slash is the
amount of ore stored on the planet. For example in the following sample output
planet 104 has 2 mine types 3, and 6 ores stored on the planet. With the ore
type 6 on planet 107 there is no production of that mine type, just some ore.
The amount of ore, industry and PDUs on ships is also shown, as is the total
amounts for the players empire at the bottom. This total includes the amount
on all the players planets and ships.

\subsection{Ally Status}%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
This shows the status of the player with respect to other players in the game.
If you are neutral to a player and they are neutral to you, they will not show
up in this table.
\begin{verbatim}

\subsection{Earth Listing}%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
This section shows the prices of ore on Earth, and which ships are on
Earth. It also lists the nearby planets, making it easier to find Earth.
If you scan the right planet you can get to Earth by turn 2 at the earliest.
This is the area that various details of Earth are printed, such as Earth
Amnesty and the type of selling permitted.

\subsection{Planet List}%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
This is the main body of the turn sheet. It lists all the information about
every planet that the player has an interest in. Ships that are orbiting the
planet are listed as well. You can get this information even if you do not
own the planet in question. The number in brackets after the number of PDUs is
the number of shots that all the PDUs fired together will generate.
\begin{verbatim}

Above are some more of PsiNinja's planets. Note that in this section quite a
few of the planets have been removed for brevity.

\subsection{Messages}%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
This section comes at the end of the turn sheet, and contains messages from
other players.
\begin{verbatim}
GENERAL MESSAGES
PsiNinja: PsiNinja desires allies. Please mail psininja@host.va
Master:Anyone with information about PsiNinjas empire please send to me

PERSONAL MESSAGES
From Grok: You use Earth Ind this turn, I will use it next turn
\end{verbatim}
These are messages from other players. General messages go to all players,
while personal messages are just to a specific player. See Section~\ref{diplo}
on Diplomacy for more details on how to send messages.

\subsection{Command History}%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
This is a list of all the actions that the computer processes by you, in the
order they were processed\footnote{Messages will not appear in this list.}.
The order on the left is the order desired and the one on the right is the
actual order carried out. If for some reason the command cannot be executed, say
because the planet you tried to jump to did not exist, you will have the reason
printed after the desired order. If a
command could only be partially carried out, like an attempt to build 20
industries, when there was only enough ore to build 3, then the actual order
will be {\tt 123B3I}. In these limited cases the limiting factor will be
shown between the two orders. In the example below, this was industry.
Scans will only appear once in the desire list.

The results of attacks, changes in ownership, and other details will also
be printed here. For attacks both the attacker and the attackee get details on
the damage done.

\section{Strategy and Tactics\label{strategy}}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

     This  section  is only to give hints on what can be  done  in
Celestial  Empire.  It is not the definitive list of what  can  be
done;  indeed the list will grow as people play the game and their
successful  strategies  are enshrined in this section  for  future
generations  of players to marvel over (Credit will  naturally  be
given  to those players who first performed the given strategy  or
tactic). If you want to keep your strategies secret just drop me a
message and I will remove them from the list.

\subsection{Planet Scans}%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{description}
\item[Piggy in the Middle --- Granny Smith]
     Use  your scans to trace a path to a  neighbor's  homeworld.
Then  you scan outwards in another direction from that  homeworld.
Once you establish the player's neighbors in that region give them
the  route to your enemies homeworld and offer a joint  or  triple
attack.

\item[Scans for Sale --- Granny Smith]
     You  are  operating a self contained empire  of  three  rings
width  readying  yourself  for that lunge  to  Earth.  Industry  is
humming along,  supplies are regular, ship production constant and
smooth.  So what do you need scans for?  Probably nothing.  So why
not sell them to players who are desperate for information.

\item[Magic Eye --- Granny Smith]
     A combination of ``Piggy in the Middle'' and ``Scans for  Sale''.
Once  a homeworld is found, you place your scan there  every  turn.
Such a ``magic eye'' will provide reams of information.  Numbers  of
ships,  what  is  being built,  industries/fighter  units,  obvious
scarce resources etc.
\end{description}

\subsection{Planetary Defense Units}%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{description}
\item[Speed Trap --- Zarg]
     To  stop an enemy from jumping straight to your  home  world,  and
then  blasting  away  all your industry before you  can  recall  your
battle ships to defend your capital, place buffer zones of PDUs on
the  planets surrounding your homeworld,  ideally about 20 PDUs  on
the  first three layers surrounding your homeworld.  Then if  your
enemy comes in at full speed to attack your home planets,  he will
have lost 60 Fighter units off every ship that participated in the
attack,  almost  certainly  stopping the  attack  cold.  If on the
other hand he comes in slowly, single jumping it, not only can you
fire on his ships as the come through with your PDUs, it also gives
you time to either recall your battleships or even build new ones.
\end{description}

\subsection{Battleships}%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{description}
\item[Security Blanket --- Missing Tiger]
     If  other players know that you have a  superbattle  cruising
around  your  inner planets they will be a bit  more  cautious  in
attacking,  just  like  the superpowers  build  nuclear  warheads.
However  the  construction of a SuperBattle is expensive  and  can
take over 20\% of your empires industrial capacity.  It is  cheaper,
though less threatening to build several smaller ships, say medium
battles.

\item[Piracy --- Missing Tiger]
     Sit  on  a trade route used by another player and wait  for  a
large  cargo ship to stop there on its way back to a  home  planet
all loaded up with goodies.  Attack it.  Severely maim it.  Most of
the cargo drops to the planet,  as the ship is unable to carry  it
due to lack of cargo units.  If you own the planet,  the cargo  is
yours.

\item[Ambush --- Missing Tiger]
     An extension of piracy.  If the battle ship is big enough  in
relation  to  its target,  you will destroy it  totally  when  you
attack.  Then if you own the planet the ship is yours. However you
will  need to transport some type-1 ore and some industry to  make
use of the ship, or you can use tractor beams.

\item[Hunting --- Missing Tiger]
     This is a high risk operation as you are usually much  nearer
the other player's home planet than you are to your own.  Send your
super  or large battle ship accompanied by a large cargo ship  carrying
industry,  PDUs and ore types 0, 1, 2 and 3 into another player's area
until you find a ship.  Attack the ship with your superbattle  and
the  planet  with  your cargo ship.  Next  turn,  drop  the  cargo
including industry,  and build fighter and cargo units on your new
ship.  Now, since you cannot reload the industry you just dropped,
you  can choose between destroying it to stop your enemy using  it
or attempt to hold the planet.
\end{description}

\subsection{Spacemines}%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{description}
\item[Dwagons Devastator --- Zer Dwagon]
     Have a large cargo ship full of spacemines lay spacemines  on
the  route  from his home planet to  his  producing  planets,  the
nearer  to the home planet the better,  and dump the whole lot  of
them  on a few planets.  If you can dump them all on your  enemies
home planet you are laughing,  as his ships take major destruction
every time they jump to his home planet.
\item[Vux's Vulture --- Bruno Wolff]
    Get to Earth early, dump a large stack of spacemines there and wait. Another
ship will come screaming in, and get destroyed by the spacemines. With the 
tractor units on your original ship, load all the spacemines, then engage the
hull and jump out of there with a new ship. An alternative is to leave the
spacemines there, and remember to have enough shields on your ship when you jump
back to Earth, there might even be a few hulls waiting for you.
\end{description}

\subsection{Earth}%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{description}
\item[Monopoly Player --- Greg James]
Get a super cargo ship to Earth with at least 100 cargo units. Buy all
of the cheapest commodity. Sell it all next turn and corner another one.
Repeat until bored.

This will allow you to amass huge amounts of Earth credits, basically
allowing you to use Earth's industry and mines as a second home. The ideal
situation is one ship at Earth playing broker, another becoming very large
off the fruits of the first, and a third shipping ore back to your home
planet in massive quantities.

{\bf Note:} due to the spectacular success of this method the first time it
was tried, game changes have been implemented that will hopefully make this
difficult/impossible in future. The main change has been the introduction of 
Earth credits, and the credit/score ratio.

\item[Game 2]
{\raggedright

    Ishmolin won by getting 30,000pts\\

\item[Game 3]
{\raggedright
Duration: 23 turns, Ended Apr 9 1992, Winner: Zethrin\\
    Zethrin won by getting 30,000pts\\
}
    At the end of the game, only Wumpsters had withdrawn, however a number
of players had stopped sending in turns. Benden when he decided to leave the game gave all his planets to Zethrin, which helped him win. This lead to the
introduction of gift limitation, so you cannot give all your planets away in a
single turn, and you cannot give your home planet away ever.
\item[Game 4]
{\raggedright
Duration: 25 turns, Ended Apr 23 1992, Winner: ISH\\
ISH won by getting 30,000+ pts\\
}
Here is what ISH recalls of the game, and the way he played it.
\begin{quotation}
I began the game when I had more spare time than
now, and spent a lot of time on diplomacy.  I made friends with neighbors
and patched up a quarrel with Klicknex after they took over the Iron-Gang
spot.  I gave the Klicknex the benefit of my vast (a few turns) CE
experience.  Later, when they decided to play only a token role in the
game, they gave me several planets and ships out of gratitude.  That was
basically the key to the game.

Since the worlds around my home were fairly rich, I didn't bother sending
any ships to Earth: I would need the points later, and in the time it
would take to get a ship to Earth and back, it could make two round trips
to a nearer planet.  I didn't realize until late in the game that I could
build R7, R8, and R9 mines on my home planet.  I did a lot of exploring,
and held the lead in points for several turns before the Klicknex gifts.
I tried to build a new ship every other turn, and I believe I had more
ships than any other player even before the Klicknex gifts.  Some were
kept small, to shuttle PDUs to outer worlds or claim more planets.  Wherever
possible, I put an industry on a planet with R4 mines and steadily built
PDUs.

When Bude and Antigone tried to take some of my planets at the end, I just
kept claiming new ones.  I sent a cargo ship to each threatened world to
postpone its fall.  I kept my only super battle at home to protect the
home world or jump to Earth to postpone its fall.  As it turns out, I
doubt that anyone realized how difficult it is to take Earth. \smiley

So basically the game was won by friendly diplomacy.

\item[Game 5]
Duration: 23 Turns, Ended Apr 11 1992, Winner: Feline

\begin{quotation}
Imperium Feline Rex in Celestial Empire 5

When I started with celemp5 I didn't have any strategies in mind, just 
play and find see where my empire will end up. So I expanded freely and 
happily, I reacted on some e-mail addresses posted and let the Empires 
know where I could be reached. My best contact was Alpha, we were fairly 
close to each other but didn't have things to trade yet. So we decided 
to stay in touch until one of us needed help. Not much later I made 
contact with Meloria both by links and e-mail. We made traded planet-
and player-info. 

Around turn10 I found out, I had made some mistakes. The most important 
thing in the beginning is to build mines of type 8 and 9, until at least 5 
each exist on your home planet. And drop on any planet you own at least 1 
PDU, so you see who entered your hemisphere.

Another mistake was building 20 cargo on each ship I owned, in the early 
phases it came in handy but when I needed an Battleship, it didn't have 
much firepower. 

Lucky for me my ally Meloria had to leave the game and because we had 
been trustful allies he gifted every single planet and Ship to me. So I 
had 40+ planets and 13 ships to my disposal. They came in useful because 
the Empire Kaspar became more annoying every turn. He took 3 planets from 
me and I took 3 planets from him. But I could build any ship I wanted so 
after some maneuvering I had a planet near his homeplanet and an empty 
hull became mine.

But this happened in the last turn, I reached the 30K points and became 
winner of this game of Celestial Empire.

\item[Game 6]
Duration: 28 turns, Ended: 17th May 1992, Winner; Warlus.\\
Vendetta gets an honourable mention for almost taking Earth. In one turn he
destroyed all of Earths PDUs, and other players ships that were on Earth.
There are now 13 hulks orbiting Earth. And as a parting gesture, dropped
200 spacemines to prevent any other ships arriving. Unfortunately the effort
drained his empire dry, and he was on the slow road to recovery when the game
ended.

In the last turn, BlueAdepts home planet was turned to slag, along with about
half a dozen ships, by Tragins new toy, the Ultra Death Star. At the end of the
game almost a third of the ships in the galaxy were hulks.

\item[Game 7]
Duration:22 turns, Ended: Feb 3 1992, Winners: Vux \& Kartheige\\
    This was the first turbo game with 3 updates a week but unfortunately was
hampered by bugs. Retchian and Skynet dropped out early on in the game.\\
Vux won by getting 30,000pts by using speculating on Earth,
forcing the introduction of Earth credits by getting more than 8,000pts in a
single turn.\\
Kartheige won by getting over 64 planets, 88 in total, a large number of which
were given to him at the last moment by ZPZX when it was obvious Vux was about
to win.

\item[Game 8]
Duration:29 turns, Ended: Jun 19 1992, Winner: Kartheige\\
Kartheige won by getting 65 planets. Honourable second goes to
ISH who got 63 planets on the last turn. The winning condition was 64
planets. This game saw the start of the new ship class, the Death Star. At
the end of the game there were two Ultra Death Stars in the galaxy.

\item[Game 9] Duration: 29 turns, Ended Jun 19 1992, Winner Darmak\\
Darmak won by taking over Earth, after reducing it to slag with his Ultra
Death Star.

\item[Game 10] Duration: 41 turns, Ended Feb 5 1993, Winner BlueAdept and
ally Winter \\
Game 10 was finally over after a massive drawn out battle over Earth that
lasted about half the game. At the end
of the battle 14 ships lay hulks on Earth, and another 7 over the other
trouble spot in the galaxy, Greybeards home planet, where Winter and
Myrtha/Algoria/Greybeard slugged it out.

\item[Game 12] Duration: 27 turns, Ended Mar 12 1993, Winner Endarian and
allied Godoraith and Meines. \\
Won by taking Earth.

\item[Game 13] Duration: 32 turns, Ended May 19 1993, Winner Salish and ally

Here is what they had to say about the game:

Game 14 was won by a strong alliance formed early, and kept secret,
between Guht and VAXXUS.  The key to its success was two-fold.  First, we
both sent ships to Earth early and built up ships with every bit of score
we could muster. Second, VAXXUS played to consumate diplomat, while
continuing to build massive warships; and Guht developed a reputation as a
madman, harassing the other players with a few ships, while giving some
ships and planets to VAXXUS.  VAXXUS then descended to Earth and preceded
to lay waste, while Guht diverted attention.
\end{quote}

\item[Game 15] Duration: 16 turns, Ended Sep 16 1993, Winner OuToLunch \\
Won by getting over 1500 income.

\begin{quote}
This was the first game with income as a winning condition, and the
income level required was set a bit too low, so the empires were only
beginning to collide when the game finished. The key to my being first
to reach the required income level was that all resources must be as
fully utilised as possible. Ships which don't move are wasted, unless
they are achieving some purpose by not moving. Industry which doesn't
build things is wasted. Large stockpiles of ore without sufficient
industry to process them are wasted. This overriding philosophy is
particularly important around turn 6, when the initial stockpiles of ore
on a home planet start to dwindle away.

Brief Hint: \\
High resource utilisation $\Rightarrow$ high efficiency. \\

\section{Hints on Play\label{hints}}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Here are some hints given by players who have won their games:

{\bf Zethrin's Hints} (Howard Bampton) Winner of Game 3.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Don't think that you have to go to, or even find Earth. I didn't put
in an appearance there until turn 20. Of course, if your next door
neighbors start dropping in, some strategically placed mines might be
of use\ldots.

\item Building industry seems to not be very useful (at least in the
first 10--15 turns), instead I should have concentrated on building more
mines. Type 0 \& 1 ore was in particularly short supply. Once you
start running low on fuel, you are in serious trouble ---\\
no fuel = little ship movement $\Rightarrow$ little new resources to build with
$\Rightarrow$ wasted industry \& no new sources of fuel.

\item Initially, I would recommend building as much cargo capacity as
possible. I would concentrate on bringing back type 1, 8 \& 9 ores.
Type 8 \& 9 can be used to build more type 1, 8 \& 9 mines.

\item When exploring, try to send along PDUs in the cargo hold. As you
acquire a planet, drop a PDU on it. This keeps other players from
accidentally capturing your planets.

\item Scanning: I used my scans to get a list of as many systems as
possible. In a long game, or one that is more violent than this one
was, even knowing a single link to a system is useful. A couple of
times, I would scan a system that was near (2 jumps) one of my systems
and one of my opponents.

\item Probably the most important: try to plan 2 turns ahead. Don't
just send ships out to pick up ore. Send them out to get enough ore of
some type so that you can build something. If you don't do this, you
may end up with part of your industry being idle each turn.

\item Don't bother to build warships until you need them. If you really
need one, just convert a Medium Cargo. Don't forget to put shields on
things, especially that new warship.

\item Look for the pattern that was used to set up the galaxy. In game
3, there were a number of research planets equidistant between 2
players.
\end{enumerate}

{\bf Ishmolins's Hints} (Rich Staats) Winner of Game 2.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Ishmolin Icon:  ``Do unto others as you would have them do unto you,
and be the type of player that people do not feel bad to let win.''

\item Ishmolin Icon:  ``React to any betrayal with overwhelming
aggression.''

\item Ishmolin Icon:  When fighting above a planet you own, you can use a
cargo ship.  Cargo units are easier to replace than fighter units if destroyed,
and you can pack the hull with PDUs which you drop on the planet prior to
battle.

\item  Produce a mixture of PDUs and Industry early on.  Use lightly armed
ships to do scouting, and drop off a PDU on each planet you find.

\item Talk to any race you discover --- what's the worst thing that could
happen.
\end{enumerate}
